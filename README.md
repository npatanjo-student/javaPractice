# shortJavaProjects
A complete repo of all my assigned java practice projects. Contains complex data structures, practice with recursion, practice with recursive backtracking, and more.

These projects represent my progression in learning java in class. 

## Brief Project Descriptions:
A more detailed description can be found as a header for each project. 

### PA4-Recursion:
This file consists of simple recursive problems and their solutions. 

### PA6-StacksQueues
This project contains examples of stacks and queues. There are examples of stacks and queues made with both arrays and linked lists. 
This project also contains a node class. 

### PA7-Generics
This is a modified version of PA6-StacksQueues. It is modified to include the use of generics. 

### PA8-HashMap
This is my own solution for a HashMap data structure. 

### PA9-PatientQueue
This project orders Patients in a priority queue. The order is based on a MinHeap. When patients are added or removed from the que, 
the program will either bubble up or bubble down

### PA10-WikiRacer
This project will link two wiki pages via links. Input1 = starting word | Input2 = target word. Output: array of path taken. 
A ladder queue, backed my a max heap (priority determined by common words found on current word page vs. target word page), is used to 
follow the word branches efficiently. Memoization and parallelization are used to speed up the process. 

### PA11-TravelingSalesperson
This project contains two methods for solving the traveling salesperson problem: heuristic and recursive backtracking. 

### PA12-Anagrams
This project uses recursive backtracking to find all anagram phrases for a string input.
